# Green_Growth_mapper
â€¢	Our project combines advanced technologies like NumPy, Python, PIL, and OpenCV with the Mean Shift Algorithm for detailed satellite image analysis, identifying potential land uses via the Microsoft Bing Earth API. It employs Zernike moments-trained classifiers to accurately estimate the required tree count for pollution reduction, aiming to enhance environmental restoration significantly. The implementation of this project has the potential to increase green cover by 30% in targeted areas, leading to an estimated 25% decrease in local pollution levels, demonstrating the project's effectiveness in leveraging technology for ecological improvement.
